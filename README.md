Project Description:

In the initial phase of the AirBnB clone project, we focused on developing the backend of the application and integrated it with a console application using the cmd module in python. All the data generated by the program is stored in a json file and can be accessed through the json module in python.

The command interpreter is designed like the Bash shell but with limited commands that are specifically tailored to the requirements of the AirBnB website. This command line interpreter acts as the frontend of the web app and enables users to interact with the backend, which is developed using python OOP programming.

The available commands include show, create, update, destroy, and count, and they allow users to create new objects, retrieve an object from a file or database, perform operations on objects, update attributes of an object, and destroy an object.

To get started with the project, users need to clone the project repository from Github, which includes the simple shell program and all its dependencies. Once installed, the program can be run on a local machine (Linux distro) for testing and development purposes. 

Get started with the AirBnB clone project by cloning the repository, git clone https://github.com/DagogoCharles/AirBnB_clone.git which will give you access to the AirBnB_clone folder containing several files essential for running the program.

Some of these files include:

/console.py: This is the primary executable file, the command interpreter for the project.

/models/engine/file_storage.py: This file contains a class that serializes instances to a JSON file and deserializes JSON files to instances.

/models/__ init __.py: This file contains a unique FileStorage instance for the application.

/models/base_model.py: This file defines all common attributes/methods for other classes.

/models/user.py, /models/state.py, /models/city.py, /models/amenity.py, /models/place.py, /models/review.py: These files define classes that inherit from BaseModel.

The program can run in two modes - Interactive and Non-interactive. In the Interactive mode, the console displays a prompt (hbnb) where the user can input and execute a command. After executing the command, the prompt appears again, waiting for a new command. This process can continue indefinitely as long as the user does not exit the program.

To begin, simply run ./console.py, followed by the command prompt (hbnb) and then start exploring the program using the help command. Get ready to experience the AirBnB clone project in action!
